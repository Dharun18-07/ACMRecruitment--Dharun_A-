optimal crossing sequence:
1.(1,2) crosses first
2.1 brings back the torch
3.(7,10) cross the bridge
4.2 brings back the torch
5.finally (1,2) cross the bridge

total time:
2+1+10+2+2= 17 minutes

logic:
we make sure that one and two cross the bridge first to bring back torches faster
we send 7 and 10 together to get rid of excess time waste
so now 1 and 2 can cross the bridge faster after receiving the torch by 2
