1.Turn on the first switch and wait for a minute
2.Turn the first switch off
3.turn the second switch on
4.now enter the room immediately and touch the bulb if its turned off

logic:
If the first switch is the bulb switch the bulb would be warm due to the passage of electricity in the filament and
if its the second switch the bulb would be on already as the second switch was kept turned on  and
if its cold, it means the third switch is the bulb switch as the bulb has not been turned on yet
